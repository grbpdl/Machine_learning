'''For non linear data
Polynomial regression is applied when data is not formed in a straight line. 
It is used to fit a linear model to non-linear data by creating new features from powers of non-linear features.
Example: Quadratic features 
x2’ = x2^2
y = w1x1 + w2*x2^2 + 6
y= w1x1 + w2x2’ + 6
