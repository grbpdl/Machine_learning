''' 
Supervised Learning is a type of machine learning used to train models from labeled training 
data. It allows you to predict output for future or unseen data.


it can be done in two way
1.Classification-If target variable is categorical (classes), then use classification algorithm
2.Regression-If target variable is a continuous numeric variable (100-2000), then use a regression algorithm


Types of Classification Algorithms
Logostics regression-Used to estimate discrete values (binary values like 0/1, yes/no, true/false ) based on given set     
of independent variable(s)
Decision Trees -Decision Trees make sequential, hierarchical decisions about the outcome variable based on 
the predictor data
Random Forest -Random Forest is an ensemble of decision trees. It gives better prediction and accuracy than 
decision tree
Naive Bayes Classifier-Based on Bayes theorem and works with an assumption that features are independent
Support Vector Machines-SVM draws hyperplane in a feature space that separates instances into different categories 
with margins in between as far apart as possible

Type of Regression Algorithms
Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
ElasticNet Regression
