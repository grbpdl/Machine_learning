'''Linear Regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between 
independent and dependent variables denoted by x and y respectively
It examime two factors

1.How closely are x and y related ?
Linear regression gives a number
between -1 and 1 indicating
the strength of correlation 
between the two variables
0 : no correlation 
1 : positively correlated 
-1 : negatively correlated

2.Prediction
When the relationship between x 
and y is known, use this to predict 
future values of y for a value of x 
This is done by fitting a regression 
line and represented by a 
linear equation:
y = a * x + b

For multiple variables
Multiple linear regression
Y = m1* x1 + m2* x2 + m3* x3 + ………+ mn* xn + c
